## What's this
Cloudygram-api-server is a basic web server which sole purpose is to serve telethon's basic functionalities.
Think of it as a microservice with a much bigger picture in mind.

For more info about telethon visit [telethon's repo.](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon)

## Cloning and running
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/skurob/cloudygram-api-server
$ cd cloudygram-api-server
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ mkdir sessions
$ python3 main.py
```

Before actually running the application make sure to create a keys.json file in the project root, containing the following:
```json
{
    "api_id": <your_api_id>,
    "api_hash": <your_api_hash>
}
```
To get your api keys simply go to [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org/auth?to=apps)

# Getting started

## Receive a code
Path: `/sendCode?phoneNumber=<international_formatted_number>`\
Calling the path above via GET method you will receive a json response as follows:
```json
{
    "isSuccess": true,
    "phoneCodeHash": "<hash_here>"
}
```
along with an official telegram message indicating the received confirmation code to use in the next step.

## Validating your code
Path: `/signin`\
All you need to do now is calling via the api via POST method, passing a json body as follows:
```json
{
    "phoneNumber": "<international_formatted_number>",
    "phoneCode": "<the_received_code>",
    "phoneCodeHash": "<from_the_previous_request>",
    "password": "<2FA_password>|<empty>"
}
```
If everything ran smoothly you will receive a positive response and a telegram notification, telling you successfully logged via the cloudygram-api-server.

## Getting user informations
Path: `/user/<international_formatted_number>/userInfo`\
Just a simple GET request

js example:
```js
const url = "http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/+393421323295/userInfo";
const getUserInfo = (url) => fetch(url, { method: "GET" })
                           .then(res => res.json());

console.log(await getUserInfo(url));

/*
{
    "userId": 12314,
    "username": "foobar",
    "firstName": "foo",
    "lastName": "bar",
    "phoneNumber": +393421323295
}
*/
```
## Getting messages in a chat
Path: `/user/<international_formatted_number>/messages/getMessages`\
This api call requires you to already have a chat-id from which you want to fetch its messages, there are few ways to do this but none are provided by this application.\
To get a chat-id possible solutions are:

- Getting it using telethon message events.
- Using a [tdlib](https://core.telegram.org/tdlib/docs/classtd_1_1td__api_1_1search_public_chats.html) function which will search for chats given a username.

When successfully called this method, you will then receive a response like so:
```json
{
    "isSuccess": true,
    "data": [
        {
            "message object": "containing info"
        },
        {
            "another message object": "containing info"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Session management
Whichever usecase you will face, it might happen that your sessions are no longer valid, this can
happen after a manual deletion of the cloudygram device via the telegram app, to avoid getting
yourself into annoying errors, I've provided two api calls in which you can check the
state of a session, and eventually clean all the non-valid sessions handled by the server.
To do this you can use the following resources.

`GET /user/<international_formatted_number>/sessionValid` "is this session valid?".\
`DELETE /cleanSessions` deletes all non-valid sessions.

These resources always return a json object with a bool field `isSuccess`.
